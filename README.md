Developed my website to display skills such as AngularJS, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap. All the code written is by myself, other then the libraries required or used.

The projects mentioned on the site are completed by me, either as a part of personal interest or academic requirement.

The 3rd party application is used to complete my messages page, as PHP script can not be used on website hosted on GitHub.
