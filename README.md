# Web Portfolio

Developed my website to display skills such as AngularJS, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap. All the code written is by myself, other then the libraries required or used.

To visit the site: http://waniakash.com

The projects mentioned on the site are completed by me, either as a part of personal interest or academic requirement. All the projects are made private due to Rochester Institute of Technology, NY academic dishonesty policy.

Incase anyone needs to view or refer to my work please feel free to message me through the website.

The 3rd party application is used to complete my messages page, as PHP script can not be used on website hosted on GitHub.
